# Pet-Segmentation-Project

A deep learning project demonstrating two primary models—U-Net and ResNet50—for the segmentation and classification of pet images. This repository explores semantic segmentation with U-Net, data augmentation techniques, and includes a ResNet50 model for additional experimentation or transfer learning.

PDF presentation explaining the project and tools used :
[Semantic Segmentation of Pets-2.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18416580/Semantic.Segmentation.of.Pets-2.pdf)

Goal: Automatically identify and segment pets (dogs, cats, etc.) in images using a U-Net model for semantic segmentation.

Secondary Objective: Experiment with ResNet50 for classification or feature extraction tasks, showcasing a transfer learning approach.

Key Techniques:
TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
Image augmentation (flips, rotations, brightness/contrast adjustments)
U-Net architecture for pixel-level segmentation
ResNet50 for classification or feature-based tasks
